# Lucy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MattivdWeem/Lucy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MattivdWeem/Lucy)
Ruby version of Lucy

## About Lucy
Lucy is my Virtual 'personal assistant' Well actually it's just an cli helper which integrates with my services, i'm so used to Lucy that i forgot i build it my self. Untill i had to install my new macbook. 

Lucy handles simple tasks like telling me if i can make my train or not, is my train delayed? Should i check my mail (more than 20 unread?.. don't no important mails.. just dont)? She tells me stuff about mat callendar, google now style. Keeps track of birthdays (yea, Facebook does this.. Lucy just does it better). And more stuff that was implemented in the last 5 years.

So why are you rebuilding Lucy? Simply the original Lucy is 5 years old, build on awfully bad code and has an way to hard install manual. 

## Ruby?
But.. but you love PHP? Why don't you rebuild in php? Simply, i need to learn Ruby. Ruby is a great modulair object orientated language. Lucy Should be build in a way that it's even extendable with bash, so no worries.
